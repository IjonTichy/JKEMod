Have the Sorcerer regenerate mana
---

---
Have the Medic get double healing, and be able to pick up medkits that wouldn't
heal him and add them to his inventory to dispense later (same with berserk
packs if he's already gone berserk)
---

---
Have each class start with only its pistol and fist, and have it pick their
weapons up through generic weapon replacements, which check your class and give
you the appropriate weapon

Any weapons not associated to a class will be effectively removed (and may be
actually removed, if I decide to)
