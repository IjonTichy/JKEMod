This is a repository for JKEMod - a Skulltag weapon compilation thingy. No, I'm
not making it from scratch - my aims are fairly ambitious, however.
See the IDEAS file for a few of the things I plan on doing. Note that I don't
update it all too often, though.

That being said, if you want to, you can ask to have your weapons included in
the next version of JKEMod. If you're interested in this, contact me
(therewasnoname on Skype, gztichy@lavabit.com on email) and send me your WAD.
I'll contact you back when I make a decision, and what changes I felt necessary
to make to preserve at least /some/ balance (or make things more overpowered -
either works, really).
I have already done this with my own "Better Doom Weapons" mod - see the Doomguy
class for all his weapons, save the BFG9000.

More will be added as more comes - after all, isn't that how it always is?


Current amount of weapons: 85 (!)
