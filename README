This is a repository for JKEMod - a Skulltag weapon compilation thingy. No, I'm
not making it from scratch - right now, I'm restructuring it so that JKEMod is
easy to work with and manipulate. That is all I am doing right now (along with
some edits as I see them necessary/useful), so don't expect anything more (maybe
slight weapon behaviour changes?).

That being said, if you want to, you can ask to have your weapons included in
the next version of JKEMod. If you're interested in this, contact me
(therewasnoname on Skype, gztichy@lavabit.com on email) and send me your WAD.
I'll contact you back when I make a decision, and what changes I felt necessary
to make to preserve at least /some/ balance.
I have already done this with my own "Better Doom Weapons" mod - see the Doomguy
class for all his weapons, save the BFG9000.

More will be added as more comes - whaddya expect, this just opened up!


Current amount of weapons: 26
