This is a repository for JKEMod - a Skulltag weapon compilation thingy. No, I'm
not making it from scratch - right now, I'm restructuring it so that JKEMod is
easy to work with and manipulate. That is all I am doing right now (along with
some edits as I see them necessary/useful), so don't expect anything more (maybe
slight weapon behaviour changes?).

More will be added as more comes - whaddya expect, this just opened up


Current amount of weapons: 10
